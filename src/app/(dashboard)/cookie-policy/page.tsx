            <p className="font-normal">
              Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile
              device when you visit a website. The term "cookies" includes all
              similar technologies, such as web beacons, tracking pixels, and
              clear GIFs, which help recognize devices and track interactions
              with online properties. Cookies set by Fullbooker are called
              first-party cookies, while those set by external service providers
              are known as third-party cookies. Third-party cookies enable
              features such as advertising, analytics, and interactive content
              and may recognize your device across different websites.
            </p>
            <h2 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">2. Why do we use Cookies?</h2>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Fullbooker uses first- and third-party cookies to enhance platform
              functionality, improve user experience, and ensure security. Some
              cookies are essential for the platform to operate smoothly, while
              others help us analyze user behavior, track preferences, and
              optimize services. Third-party cookies may be used for
              advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention. In some cases,
              cookies allow event organizers to understand user interests
              related to their events. These technologies help us recognize
              returning users, personalize content, and improve overall platform
              performance.

            </h2>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Fullbooker uses different types of cookies to ensure platform
              functionality, enhance user experience, and improve security.
              Below are the categories of cookies we use:
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              These cookies are necessary for Fullbooker to function properly.
              They enable core features such as secure logins, account
              authentication, privacy settings, and system stability. Without
              these cookies, some parts of the platform may not work correctly.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.2 Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Functionality cookies enhance user experience by remembering
              preferences, language settings, and customizations. While not
              essential, they allow for a more seamless browsing experience.
              Disabling them may limit certain platform features.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.3 Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              These cookies help us analyze how users interact with Fullbooker,
              including tracking website traffic, user engagement, and
              navigation patterns. We use analytics cookies to improve platform
              performance, identify issues, and optimize content. Some
              third-party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, may
              also use these cookies.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.4 Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Advertising cookies enable personalized ads based on your activity
              on Fullbooker and other websites. They prevent repetitive ads,
              measure ad effectiveness, and deliver targeted advertisements.
              These cookies may be set by third-party advertisers, including
              Google and Facebook.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.5 Organizer Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Event organizers may use cookies on Fullbooker to track engagement
              with their events, personalize promotions, and measure ad campaign
              effectiveness. Fullbooker does not control these cookies, and
              users should review the respective organizer's privacy policies.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">3.6 Flash Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Flash cookies store data using Adobe Flash technology and are used
              for security, settings preferences, and enabling interactive
              features such as videos. These cookies require separate management
              through Adobe's website settings.

            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-2">
              3.7 Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, and Trackers
            </h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              These small graphic images or code snippets track user
              interactions with emails, ads, and web pages. They help Fullbooker
              measure engagement, improve marketing campaigns, and enhance
              service delivery.

              3.8 Server Logs and Device Information Cookies
            </h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              These cookies collect data on your device, browser, IP address,
              operating system, and geographic location. They help us
              authenticate users, prevent fraud, and improve security while

            <p className="font-normal">
              Fullbooker uses cookies that may be stored on your device for

              4.1 Temporary (Session) Cookies
            </h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Session cookies are stored temporarily while you browse
              Fullbooker. They enable seamless navigation and may be used for
              internal reporting. These cookies expire once you close your
              browser, meaning no data is stored on your device after your
              session ends.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-medium mb-1">4.2 Persistent Cookies</h3>
            <p className="font-normal">
              Persistent cookies remain on your device even after you close your
              browser. These cookies help us analyze long-term browsing
              behavior, personalize your experience, and deliver relevant
              advertising. Their duration variesâ€”some may last a few hours,
              while others may remain for weeks or years, depending on their
              function.

              Fullbooker may update this Cookie Policy periodically to reflect
              changes in the cookies we use, operational adjustments, legal
              requirements, or regulatory updates. We encourage users to review

              Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify
              your browser settings to decline, block, or delete cookies. To do
              so, visit the Help section of your browser's toolbar for
              instructions on managing cookie preferences. Flash cookies operate
              differently from standard browser cookies and may require separate
              management through Adobe's Global Privacy Settings Panel.
              Additionally, mobile devices may offer cookie control options
              through device settings; refer to your manufacturer's instructions
              for details. Please note that disabling or rejecting cookies may
